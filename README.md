Digital Metrology Quality Infrastructure

This project has been develompment as POC for the Ph.D thesis "Enabling Digital Metrology Traceability for EU Metrology Cloud: A Self Sovrain Approach"

The project implement a Digital Metrology Infrastructure for Digital Calibration Certificate based on Ethereum based private blockchain.

The infrastructure has been  implemented with a pure naive blockchain approach and with a self sovrain identity approach with respect of the w3c verifiable

credential data model.

The repository is organaized as follow :

  * DATA MODELS : contain the Verifiable Credential schemas and the Digital Certificate schemas both in JSON-LD and XML schema format
  * CONTRACTS: contain the smart contracts for both approaches
  * TEST: the test file is used to measure gas comsumption of required operations for both approach
